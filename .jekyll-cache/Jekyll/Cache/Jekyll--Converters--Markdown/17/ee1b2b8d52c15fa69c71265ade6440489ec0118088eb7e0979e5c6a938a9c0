I"±<p>I was trying to add comment function under my personal website. Since my personal website was built on the github by jekyII, which is a static website. Therefore to implement the comment function, I need the help with the third-party software. Of course, disqus is the first candidate that you can think about but it is not good option for china user as some known reason.
