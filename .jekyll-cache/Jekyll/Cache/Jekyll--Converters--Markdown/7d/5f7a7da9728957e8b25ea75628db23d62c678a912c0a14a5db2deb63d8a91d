In my last article, I have introduced how to create a blog based on Github pages, if you havenâ€™t read it and you want to read, find the blog at <a href="/daviddong.github.io/web/github/2018/03/23/Github-github-blog.html">here</a>. Following that article, this page will give a brief introduction about Jekyll and its installation.</p>
