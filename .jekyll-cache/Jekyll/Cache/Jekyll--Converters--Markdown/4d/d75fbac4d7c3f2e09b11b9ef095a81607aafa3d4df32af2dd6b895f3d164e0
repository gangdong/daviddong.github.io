I")<p>I has been trying to add comment function under my personal website during the past few days. My personal website was built on the github by jekyII, Jekyll is just a tool for generating static web pages, and does not need database support which means,  I need the help with the third-party software. Of course, disqus is the first candidate that you can think about however it is not a good option for china user as some known reason. After searched some popular website comments tools, I decided to use gitalk to construct the comment function.</p>
