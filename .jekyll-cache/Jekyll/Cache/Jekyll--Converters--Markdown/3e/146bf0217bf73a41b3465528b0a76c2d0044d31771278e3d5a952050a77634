I"â<p>I was trying to add comment function under my personal website. Since my personal website was placed on the github by jekyII constructed, which is a static website. Therefore to implement the comment function, I need the help with the third-party software. Of course, disqus is the first candidate to be thought about but it is not good option for china user as some known reason. After searched some popular tools, I decided to use gitalk to construct the comment function.</p>
