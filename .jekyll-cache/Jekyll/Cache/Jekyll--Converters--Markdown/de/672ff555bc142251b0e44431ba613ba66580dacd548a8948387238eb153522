I"Ð<p>I have constructed my personal website by jekyll on github pages, I thought I would write a little blog post about how to make your own website by jekyll on GitHub Pages.<br />
I would separate the contents into short blogs, reading long articles are always easy to make people feel weary.<br />
This page will introduce how to create your personal blog based on github pages. Next pages I will introduce Jekyll and how to use it to enrich your blog.<br /></p>
