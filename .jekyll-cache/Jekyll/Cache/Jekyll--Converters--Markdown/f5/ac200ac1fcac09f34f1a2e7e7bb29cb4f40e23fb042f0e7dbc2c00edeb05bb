I"&<p>Recently I need to read system property in my Android apk development. I checked the Android documents and found that Android has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Systemproperties</code> class to handle this kind of requirement. However <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Systemproperties</code> class isnâ€™t a public class of SDK, which means it is invisible to the apk developer. My understanding is that google wants this class to be used for Android source developer rather than application developer.</p>
