I"Ï<p>Iâ€™ve met an error <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validation Failed (422)</code> when using Gitalk in my blog.</p>

<p>I posted a new article in my blog and found the Gitalk report such issue. My Gitalk has been working for a long time before this issue occurs. Iâ€™ve checked that the Gitalk for my other posts works normal and only the new post has issue, which means the issue should be a standalone problem that related to the post self.</p>

<p>By searching google <a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk/issues/102">gitalk issue #102</a> I understood the problem is that the length of my new postâ€™s URL is excessive long <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(&gt; 50 characters)</code>.</p>

<p>For every post, the Gitalk will create an issue under your blog project repository in Github to track the comment thread. The issue id is used to form the issueâ€™s label and Gitalk uses the label to identify comment thread.</p>

<p><img src="/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-gitalk-fix-01.PNG" alt="example" title="example" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>However the problem here is that label length is restricted to maximum 50 characters ( Not sure if it is a hidden rule or a BUG here ðŸ˜• ).</p>

<p>In my Gitalk configuration, the issue id is set to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">id: </span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">page</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">url</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.url</code> is too long and is beyond the restriction, the issueâ€™s label cannot be created and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Validation Failed</code> error will be threw out.</p>

<p>Since limitation is clear now, letâ€™s fix it.    <br /></p>

<p>The straightforward way is to use a shorter URL to avoid this issue. But I donâ€™t like this restriction that blocking I write post. To convert the URL to a fixed length string looks like a better solution. Why not try hash function? The interesting thing is that I found there has already been a same solution online <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/death05/article/details/83618887">-&gt; issue fix</a>, which use the <strong>MD5</strong> method. This method not only unifies the URL length but also differentiates them.</p>

<p>It is good!</p>

<p>There is workable <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5">JavaScript-MD5</a> lib on the Github, I folk it and the rest thing is quite simple.</p>

<p>I add the <strong>MD5 JS</strong> calling in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comments.html</code></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/daviddong.github.io/assets/js/md5.min.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and reset the Gitalk id to</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">id: </span><span class="n">md5</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pathname</span><span class="p">),</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Commit the change.</p>

<p>I reopen the page and the error is gone, by checking the Gitalk issue label, it has been converted to MD5 code.</p>

<p><img src="/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-gitalk-fix-02.PNG" alt="example" title="example" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Which means the solution is working now! ðŸ˜Š</p>
