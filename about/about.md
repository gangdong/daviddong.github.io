  <div class = "about-page"> Hello! My name is David Dong and this is my website.<br><br>

  I live and work on the Peking city of China :cn: . Here I write about what ever is on my mind, which tends to be related to designing and programming, since that’s what I do and I really enjoy helping people discover new skills and ideas.<br><br>
  
  Outside of work, my main interest is travel. I love to explore all kinds of landscape and experience different custom around world. I had some interesting stories about my travel and :camera: some beautiful photos, which has been collected into my <a href = "https://rainbow-ux.github.io/traveler-blog.github.io/">Album</a>.<br><br>
