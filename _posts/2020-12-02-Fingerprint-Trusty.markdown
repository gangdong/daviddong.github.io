I have completed a Android platform fingerprint implementation on Trusty TEE recently for working requirement. This page will try to give some useful information, which is a summary of my work and might be helpful for somebody who want to bring up fingerprint application on Trusty TEE.

## <span id ="1">1. Trusty TEE</span>
As one of the biometric authentication on Android platform, fingerprint implementation must meet android security specifications. Android uses a separated secure Operating System (OS) to guarantee the security of biometric application - we call it TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), Which runs on the same processor as the Android OS and is isolated from the rest of the system by both hardware and software. They run parallel to each other but secure OS has access to the full power of a device’s main processor and memory but is completely isolated. 

There are multiple commercial TEE OS on the Android platform supported by the third-part companies, Such as QSEE, ISEE, TBase and so on. Trusty is one of them and unlike them Trusty TEE is supported by Google. Trusty TEE is trying to provide the users a reliable and free open source alternative for their Trusted Execution Environment.

Google official documents provides more information about

## <span id ="2">2. Memory Restriction of Trusty TEE</span>
### <span id ="2.1">2.1 Max available memory</span>
The total memory that Trusty TEE can provide is 32M, suggests allocate 10M memory (heap + stack + ta image self) for fingerprint to use. For example, using 6M heap and 3M stack.
### <span id ="2.2">2.2 Max buffer size for communication between CA and TA</span>
+ a. The communication between CA and TA is limited in size, and the overall size is limited to 128KB, including message header. Therefore, the buffer size `TAC_SHARED_BUFFER_SIZE` should be less than 128K.
{% highlight console %}
#define TAC_SHARED_BUFFER_SIZE 1024 * 120 //should not be greater than 128k
{% endhighlight %}
+ b. Accordingly, the actual data size that can be used for effective transmission between CA and TA is limited to `1024*128-sizeof(union ta_target_commands)-sizeof(int32_t)`.
{% highlight console %}
/* ISEE may need extra room for their own header */
#if defined(ISEE)
#define MAX_CHUNK ((SECURE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE) - (MAX_COMMAND_SIZE) - 64)
#elif defined(TOS)
#define MAX_CHUNK ((SECURE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE) - (MAX_COMMAND_SIZE) - 4)
#else
#define MAX_CHUNK ((SECURE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE) - (MAX_COMMAND_SIZE))
#endif
{% endhighlight %}
+ c. When the data to be transferred is greater than the maximum limit, consider transferring in batches.
+ d. Change the size of heap and stack in the manifest file.
{% highlight c %}
trusty_app_manifest_t TRUSTY_APP_MANIFEST_ATTRS trusty_app_manifest =
   {
 
        /* UUID : {4304bef6-36e5-4d90-94b0-1ea4cd51d40b} */
       /* { 0x4304bef6, 0x36e5, 0x4d90,

      { 0x4304bef6, 0x36e5, 0x4d91,
        { 0x94, 0xb0, 0x1e, 0xa4, 0xcd, 0x51, 0xd4, 0x0c } },
 
     /* optional configuration options here */
    {
        /*apply 6M heap and 3M stack*/
       TRUSTY_APP_CONFIG_MIN_HEAP_SIZE(6*1024*1024),
       TRUSTY_APP_CONFIG_MIN_STACK_SIZE(3 * 1024 * 1024),
      },
    };
{% endhighlight %}

## <span id ="3">3. TEE Communication</span>
+ a. Adopt the dynamic TA mechanism which will load TA and run TA's main function when CA calls function `connect()`. When CA calls `disconnect()` the TA process exits. Therefore, in a life cycle, there is no  need to connect or disconnect each IPC communication.<br>
+ b. There are many IPC communications between CA and TA. Every time IPC communication, the buffer received and sent by CA needs to be reallocated. The same buffer should not be used by IPC multiple times. In our code this method has already been implemented.<br>
+ c. Trusty TEE provides 2 ports for communication, `secure port` and `non-secure port`. <br>
   **Secure port** - for other TA app access.<br>
   **Non secure port** - for CA access TA app.<br>
   For fingerprint, it needs to use `non-secure port` and if has payment requirement, needs to use `secure port`.<br>
+ d. Should define the same port name between CA and TA, An example that we are using "com.android.trusty.fpctzapp".<br>
+ e. Should use unique uuid to differentiate with other fingerprint vendor.<br>
+ f. About IPC: the Trusty APIs use `send_msg()`/`get_msg()`/`read_msg()`/`put_msg()` to send/retrieve message between CA and TA, the calling sequence should be correct. One lesson learn in my software bring up is that the communication was failed after executed one time successful communication. The communication was hang up after then and TA wasn't able to get the message from CA. The failure was due to missing the `put_msg()` calling after executed `read_msg()`.

## <span id ="4">4. About SPI usage</span>
It is related to hardware platform, on Spreadtrum SC9863, it doesn't need to configure SPI and will only use `ioctl()` for transmission.
