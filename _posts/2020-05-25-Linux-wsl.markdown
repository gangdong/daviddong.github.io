I recently used WSL for development. This article makes some notes for the WSL installation and usage. 

Below is the official introduction of WSL, I copied it here as a startup.

### What is WSL?
The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine.

You can:

+ Choose your favorite GNU/Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store.
+ Run common command-line tools such as grep, sed, awk, or other ELF-64 binaries.
+ Run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line applications including:
Tools: vim, emacs, tmux *Languages: NodeJS, Javascript, Python, Ruby, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go, etc. *Services: SSHD, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
+ Install additional software using own GNU/Linux distribution package manager.
+ Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell.
+ Invoke GNU/Linux applications on Windows.

### Installation
You can refer to [installation guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), the introduction is detailed. You can complete the installation of WSL1 and WSL2 if you need easily just by following the guidance step by step. 

### Usage
On above procedure, you will be requested to choose one Linux OS to install, the choice has 
+ Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
+ Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
+ openSUSE Leap 15.1
+ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5
+ SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1
+ Kali Linux
+ Debian GNU/Linux
+ Fedora Remix for WSL
+ Pengwin
+ Pengwin Enterprise
+ Alpine WSL
+ After installing the Linux OS at Windows store.

I choose Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as my Linux system and installed. The system installation is quite faster than installing on virtual machine as my  own experience. During the process, no need to input any information. 
After installation, just open CMD console and input ubuntu, you will run ubuntu on your windows system.
