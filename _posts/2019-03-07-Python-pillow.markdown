I recently completed some image processing works with Pillow Library. Pillow provides a powerful function and has friendly APIs to the developer. I thought it is necessary to make some notes here for the usage. 

### What is Pillow?
We cannot say Pillow is PIL, even total from PIL. Actually Pillow is open source project of Github, it is more like a derived branch of PIL. We all know PIL (Python Image Library) is the previous third-party image processing library of python and almost regarded as the official image processing library of Python because of the powerful function. However the last PIL release is at build 1.1.7 in 2009 which can only support Python 2. PIL’s release schedule is too infrequent so that some volunteers created a open source project on Github for providing a compatible version on the basis of PIL. It's called "Pillow". Pillow added in some features based on PIL and provided support to Python 3. With the update of version and many bug fixes from many contributors, Pillow has developed into a more dynamic image processing library than PIL itself. Pillow can be said to have replaced PIL.

The source code of Pillow is at [Github repository](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow). <br>
The official website is [here](https://python-pillow.org/).<br>

### What Can Pillow do? 
Pillow provides fairly powerful image processing capabilities for Python. It can do many things related to image processing and support extensive file format.

Below is official description of Pillow.

**Image Archives**
The Python Imaging Library is ideal for image archival and batch processing applications. You can use the library to create thumbnails, convert between file formats, print images, etc.

The current version identifies and reads a large number of formats. Write support is intentionally restricted to the most commonly used interchange and presentation formats.

**Image Display**
The current release includes Tk PhotoImage and BitmapImage interfaces, as well as a Windows DIB interface that can be used with PythonWin and other Windows-based toolkits. Many other GUI toolkits come with some kind of PIL support.

For debugging, there’s also a show() method which saves an image to disk, and calls an external display utility.

**Image Processing**
The library contains basic image processing functionality, including point operations, filtering with a set of built-in convolution kernels, and colour space conversions.

The library also supports image resizing, rotation and arbitrary affine transforms.

There’s a histogram method allowing you to pull some statistics out of an image. This can be used for automatic contrast enhancement, and for global statistical analysis.

### Usage

**Installation**

Below is the python version information that Pillow can support.
![support version]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-01.png){: .center-image }

Pillow has been packaged into a standard Python library so the installation is quite easy, uses pip complete installation.

Here is a reminder that Pillow and PIL cannot co-exist in the same environment. Before installing Pillow, need to uninstall PIL firstly.

Install Pillow with pip:
```python
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```

**Image Class**

The most important class in the Python Imaging Library is the Image class. <br>
Before use the library, need to import it firstly.<br>
```python
#python2 
import Image 

#python3 
from PIL import Image
```

**Some useful method**

Here we take a example of python3.

+ **Open/Show**<br>
To load an image from a file, use the open() function in the Image module. If successful, this function returns an Image object. You can now use instance attributes to examine the file contents:
```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.jpg")
print(im.size,im.mode,im.format)
(750, 500) RGB JPEG
im.show()
```
The format attribute identifies the source of an image. If the image was not read from a file, it is set to None. The size attribute is a 2-tuple containing width and height (in pixels). The mode attribute defines the number and names of the bands in the image, and also the pixel type and depth. Common modes are “L” (luminance) for greyscale images, “RGB” for true color images, and “CMYK” for pre-press images.<br>
Above four row codes will open and display a image on the screen. it will use the default image viewer of your computer to show the image.
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-02.jpg){: .center-image }

+ **resize** 
```python
print(im.size)
(750, 500)
im = im.resize((150,100))
im.show()
print(im.size)
(150, 100)
```
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-03.JPG){: .center-image }

+ **transpose**
```python
im_rotate_180 = im.transpose(Image.ROTATE_180)
im_rotate_180.show()
```
![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-04.JPG){: .center-image }

The parameters can be <br>
-**Image.FLIP_LEFT_RIGHT**, which means to flip the image left and right<br>
-**Image.FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM**, which means to flip the image up and down<br>
-**Image.ROTATE_90**, which means to rotate the image 90 ° anticlockwise<br>
-**Image.ROTATE_180**, which means to rotate the image 180 ° anticlockwise<br>
-**Image.ROTATE_270**, Means to rotate the image 270 ° anticlockwise<br>
-**Image.TRANSPOSE**, which means to rotate the image (equivalent to 90 ° clockwise rotation)<br>
-**Image.TRANSVERSE**, which means to transpose the image and then turn it horizontally<br>

+ **crop**
```python
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
box = (100,100,200,200)
region = im.crop(box)
region.show()
```
The above code cuts out a box rectangle area on the im image and displays it. Box is a tuple with four numbers (upper left, upper left, lower right, lower right). Each pixel represents a coordinate unit. Crop () still returns an image object.<br>

![image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-05.JPG){: .center-image }

+ **filter**<br>
Image can provide below filters.<br>
**BLUR、CONTOUR、DETAIL、EDGE_ENHANCE、EDGE_ENHANCE_MORE、EMBOSS、FIND_EDGES、SMOOTH、SMOOTH_MORE、SHARPEN**.<br>
Below we demonstrate some of the effect of filters.

```python
from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageFilter
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
im = im.resize((150,100))
blur = im.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
conf = im.filter(ImageFilter.CONTOUR)
edge = im.filter(ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES)
smooth = im.filter(ImageFilter.SMOOTH)
sharpen = im.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)
emboss = im.filter(ImageFilter.EMBOSS)
blur.show()
conf.show()
edge.show()
smooth.show()
sharpen.show()
emboss.show()
``` 
**BLUR**<br>
![blur]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-06.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**CONTOUR**<br>
![blur]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-07.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**EDGE**<br>
![blur]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-08.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**SMOOTH**<br>
![blur]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-09.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**SHARPEN**<br>
![blur]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-10.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**EMBOSS**<br>
![emboss]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-11.JPG){: .center-image }<br>

**rotate**
```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
w,h = im.size
im = im.resize(((int)(w/2),(int)(h/2)))
im_45 = im.rotate(45)
im_90 = im.rotate(90)
im_45.show()
im_90.show()
```
**rotate 45 degree**<br>
![rotate45]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-12.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**rotate 90 degree**<br>
![rotate45]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-13.JPG){: .center-image }<br>

**convert**<br>
Convert() is a method of image instance object. It accepts a mode parameter to specify a color mode. The value of mode can be as follows:<br>
· 1 (1-bit pixels, black and white, stored with one pixel per byte)<br>
· L (8-bit pixels, black and white)<br>
· P (8-bit pixels, mapped to any other mode using a color palette)<br>
· RGB (3x8-bit pixels, true color)<br>
· RGBA (4x8-bit pixels, true color with transparency mask)<br>
· CMYK (4x8-bit pixels, color separation)<br>
· YCbCr (3x8-bit pixels, color video format)<br>
· I (32-bit signed integer pixels)<br>
· F (32-bit floating point pixels)<br>

```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
w,h = im.size
im = im.resize(((int)(w/2),(int)(h/2)))
im_1 = im.convert("1")
im_L = im.convert("L")
im_P = im.convert("P")
im_CMYK = im.convert("CMYK")
im_F = im.convert("F")
im_1.show()
im_L.show()
im_P.show()
im_CMYK.show()
im_F.show()
```
mode **"1"**<br>
![mode1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-14.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
mode **"L"**<br>
![model]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-15.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
mode **"p"**<br>
![modep]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-16.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
mode **"CMYK"**<br>
![modecmyk]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-17.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
mode **"F"**<br>
![modef]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-18.JPG){: .center-image }<br>

**paste**<br>
Paste one image onto another.
```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
w,h = im.size
im = im.resize(((int)(w/2),(int)(h/2)))
print(im.size)
box = (0,0,100,100)
region = im.crop(box)
im.paste(region,(100,100))
im.show()
```
in above code, "region" is the object to be pasted. <br>

![paste]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-19.JPG){: .center-image }<br>

**split**<br>
Split () method can separate each channel of the original image. For example, for RGB image, the three color channels R, G and B can be separated.
```python
from PIL import Image
im = Image.open("python-pillow-02.JPG")
w,h = im.size
im = im.resize(((int)(w/2),(int)(h/2)))
r,g,b = im.split()
r.show()
g.show()
b.show()
```
**R**<br>
![R]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-20.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**G**<br>
![G]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-21.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
**B**<br>
![B]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-22.JPG){: .center-image }<br>

**merge**<br>
Merge method and split method are relative. it combines multiple single channel sequences to form a multi-channel image. Mode is the mode of the combined image, such as "RGB", and channels is the sequence composed of multiple single channels.
```python
im_merge = Image.merge("RGB",[r,g,b])
im_merge.show()
```
![merge]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/image/python-pillow-23.JPG){: .center-image }<br>
