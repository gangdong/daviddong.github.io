After read [last article](https://gangdong.github.io/daviddong.github.io/web/2019/03/27/Web-jekyll-installation.html) you should complete the installation of Jekyll and download a Jekyll theme on your computer. 

This page will give a brief introduction of the Jekyll grammar, let's start this article from the source code of the theme you downloaded. 

### Jekyll directory structure
Unzip the package you downloaded and check the directory structure.The Jekyll directory structure mainly includes the following directories.

![directory](https://gangdong.github.io/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-jekyll-2-directory.png)

The description of each folder.

![directory](https://gangdong.github.io/daviddong.github.io/assets/image/web-jekyll-2-directory-description.png)

Every file or directory beginning with the following characters: ., _ , # or ~ in the source directory will not be included in the destination folder. Such paths will have to be explicitly specified via the config file in the include directive to make sure theyâ€™re copied over.

### Liquid
Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language to process templates.
Generally in Liquid you output content using two curly braces and perform logic statements by surrounding them in a curly brace percentage sign. 

To learn more about Liquid, check out the [official Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

### Variables

Jekyll traverses your site looking for files to process. Any files with front matter are subject to processing. For each of these files, Jekyll makes a variety of data available via Liquid. The following is a reference of the available data.

#### global variables

#### site variables

#### page variables

#### paginator variables

above is the description from the official docs. talk is always easy, next I will write some code to demonstrate the usage. 

```Jekyll
This page's title is {{page.title}}
This page's name is {{page.name}}
This page's url is {{page.url}}
This page's id is {{page.id}}
This page's date is {{page.date}}
This page's categories is {{page.categories}}
This page's collection is {{page.collection}}
This page's tags is {{page.tags}}
This page's dir is {{page.dir}}
This page's path is {{page.path}}
