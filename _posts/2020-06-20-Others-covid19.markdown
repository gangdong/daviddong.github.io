It has been `196` days passed since the first case was reported at WUHAN city, China. During the past half year, millions of people were infected and more than `400000` died. :fearful:

When will we end this pandemic? Do we have to co-exist with this virus in a long term? What is the world like after the epidemic? 

Who knows? But I believe we will win the battle, the human beings will keep living on this planet, just like what they have done for hundreds of thousands of years. 

God bless! I am lucky. In china :cn:, the situation is under control quickly after a short chaos at the beginning. People around me, my family and friends are all healthy, no one was infected. 

I hope the epidemic will eventually pass and we will return to the normal life soon! :fist: 

:pray:
