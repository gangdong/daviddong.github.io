This page will continue to give a brief introduction of the Jekyll grammar. 

After reading [last article]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2018/03/27/Web-jekyll-installation.html) you should complete the installation of Jekyll and download a Jekyll theme on your computer. 

Let's start this article from the source code of the theme you downloaded. 

{% include toc.html %}

## Jekyll directory structure
Unzip the package you downloaded and check the directory structure. The Jekyll directory structure mainly includes the following directories.

![directory]({{site.cdn_baseurl}}/assets/image/web-jekyll-2-directory.png)

The description of each folder.

![directory]({{site.cdn_baseurl}}/assets/image/web-jekyll-2-directory-description.png)

Every file or directory beginning with the following characters: ., _ , # or ~ in the source directory will not be included in the destination folder. Such paths will have to be explicitly specified via the config file in the include directive to make sure theyâ€™re copied over.

## Liquid
Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language to process templates.
Generally in Liquid, you output content using two curly braces and perform logic statements by surrounding them in a curly brace percentage sign. 

To learn more about Liquid, check out the [official Liquid Documentation](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

## Variables

Jekyll traverses your site looking for files to process. Any files with front matter are subject to processing. For each of these files, Jekyll makes a variety of data available via Liquid. The following is a reference to the available data.

### global variables

*Talk is always easy*, next, I will write some codes to demonstrate the usage.
